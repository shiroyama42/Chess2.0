/**
 * The com.shiroyama.chess2.chessboard.model package provides classes for representing
 * the chess board, pieces, and game state in the Chess2 game.
 *
 * This package contains components that define the core model of the chess game, including
 * the board representation, piece positioning with floating-point coordinates, and the
 * underlying data structures needed for game logic.
 *
 * <p>Key components include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.shiroyama.chess2.chessboard.model.ChessBoard} - Manages the chess board state,
 *       piece movement, attacks, and promotions</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.shiroyama.chess2.chessboard.model.TargetPoint} - Represents positions on the
 *       chess board with floating-point coordinates for precise positioning</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The model package serves as the foundation for the game mechanics, providing the data
 * structures that the controller and view components interact with to create the complete
 * Chess2 experience.
