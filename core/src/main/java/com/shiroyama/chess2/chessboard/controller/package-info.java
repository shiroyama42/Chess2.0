/**
 * The chessboard.controller package provides classes for managing the game state and UI interactions
 * in the Chess2 game.
 *
 * This package contains components that handle game state management, user input processing,
 * board visualization, and geometric utilities for the chess board interface. It serves as
 * the controller layer between the chess board model and the user interface.
 *
 * <p>Key components include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link com.shiroyama.chess2.chessboard.controller.GameState} - Manages the state of the
 *       chess board, including turn management, piece selection, and valid move highlighting</li>
 *   <li>{@link com.shiroyama.chess2.chessboard.controller.IntRect} - Provides geometric utilities
 *       for representing rectangular areas on the chess board with integer coordinates</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The controller package works closely with the model package to translate user inputs into
 * game actions and to visualize the current state of the game board.
